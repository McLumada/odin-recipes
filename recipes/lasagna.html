        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 tsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
            <li>500g / 18oz minced beef</li>
            <li>400g / 14 oz chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 vegetable stock cube</li>
            <li>1 tsp oregano</li>
            <li>100ml / 3.5 fl oz hot water</li>
            <li>150g / 5oz frozen vegetables</li>
            <li>8 dried lasagne sheets</li>
            <li>150ml / 5oz creme fraiche</li>
            <li>75g / 2.5oz grated cheese</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 220c / 420f.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a frying pan or large saucepan.
            Add the onion and fry for 2-3 minutes before adding
            the crushed garlic. Fry for another minute and then
            add the minced beef.</li>
            <li>At this point I turn the heat up high to brown 
            the mince as quickly as possible. Stir regularly to 
            ensure it doesnt stick or burn.</li>
            <li>Once the meat has browned add the chopped
            tomatoes and crumble in the stock cube. Add the
            oregano and frozen vegetables and finally add the 
            water (you can add more water if it seems too dry).</li>
            <li>Stir until everything is well combined and 
            continue to cook on high for approximately 7 minutes.
            Once the mince mixture has cooked remove from the
            heat and start to assemble your lasagne.</li>
            <li>I used a 8in x 8in dish which nicely fits two
            lasagne sheets side by side but you can use any dish
            you wish.</li>
            <li>Assemble the lasagne by alternating layers of
            the minced beef mixture and the lasagne sheets,
            finishing with a lasagne sheet layer on top. Spoon 
            on the creme fraiche and spread it over the top of
            the lasagne.</li>
            <li>Finally add the grated cheese and put the lasagne in the oven.</li>
            <li>Reduce the oven temperature to 200c / 400f and
            bake for 15 minutes. You can test to make sure the 
            lasagne sheets have cooked by sticking in a sharp
            knife.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately with a green salad or mixed vegetables.</li>
        </ol>
