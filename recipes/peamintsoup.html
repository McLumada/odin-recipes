            <li>1 ounce/25 grams butter</li>
            <li>1 medium red onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>5 cups/750 grams shelled fresh peas</li>
            <li>1 cup/75 grams mint leaves, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>3 1/2 cups/1 liter vegetable stock, divided</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon sea salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon freshly ground pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup/75 grams freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>In a large saucepan, gently heat the oil and butter. Add the chopped onion and cook over a gentle heat for 10 minutes or until the onion is soft but not brown. Stir continuously to make sure the onion does not burn..</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and cook for another 3 minutes, again stirring. </li>
            <li>Add 3 3/4 cups/562 grams of the fresh or frozen peas, the chopped mint leaves, and 2 3/4 cups/750 milliliters of the stock. Cover the saucepan with a tight-fitting lid and cook at a medium boil for 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Once cooked, blend the soup in a food processor, blender, or an immersion blender to create a thick puree.</li>
            <li>Return the puree to the pan, season with salt and pepper, and add the remaining peas and stock. Cook for an additional 5 minutes to ensure the newly added peas are cooked.</li>
            <li>If using grated Parmesan cheese, place a small mound in the center of a warmed soup bowl. Pour the warm soup around the cheese. Drizzle with a few drops of the extra-virgin olive oil. </li>
            <li>Serve immediately with warm, crusty bread on the side and enjoy!</li>
